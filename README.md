# 180R

> *"Because every F1 nerd deserves access to the same data that costs Mercedes millions."*

A comprehensive Formula 1 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that delivers **complete F1 intelligence** with the precision of a Swiss chronometer and the speed of a DRS overtake. Named after those infamous 180-degree hairpin corners that separate the wheat from the chaff in F1 strategy.

## What This Actually Does

While other F1 apps give you pretty graphics and basic timings, 180R gives you the **complete arsenal of F1 data** that teams use to win championships. Think of it as your personal Adrian Newey, Ross Brawn, and James Vowles rolled into one, but without the politics.

## Example Data Quality

**Real-time telemetry data:**
```javascript
{
  "driver_number": 4,
  "speed": 312,
  "throttle": 100,
  "brake": false,
  "drs": 12,
  "gear": 8,
  "rpm": 11500
}
```

**Championship scenarios:**
```javascript
{
  "finishing_position": 1,
  "points_gained": 25,
  "new_championship_position": 2,
  "points_to_leader": 47,
  "championship_impact": "Major positive impact"
}
```

**Intelligent data limiting:**
- **Smart sampling** preserves race progression without oversized responses
- **Timeout handling** provides graceful fallbacks when APIs are slow
- **Status indicators** show data source health (`online`, `timeout`, `error`)
- **Fallback suggestions** guide you to working alternatives

## Claude Desktop Integration

Add this to your Claude Desktop config and suddenly you're the most informed person in any F1 discussion:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "180r": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/180R/mcp-server.js"],

}
```

## Data Sources

**üî¥ [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org)** - Real-time race data more accurate than FIA timing screens  
**üèõÔ∏è [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd/)** - Complete F1 historical database (1950-present)  
**‚ö° [F1 LiveTiming API](https://livetiming.formula1.com)** - Official F1 timing streams  

The triple-threat combination that gives you **complete F1 intelligence**.

## Why "180R"?

Named after the 180-degree corners found on legendary F1 circuits - those sharp hairpins where strategy matters more than raw speed. Think Monaco's Grand Hotel Hairpin, or Hungaroring's Turn 2. These corners don't care about your straight-line speed; they reward precision, patience, and perfect timing.

Just like this server: it's not about flashy graphics or marketing fluff. It's about delivering the exact data you need, exactly when you need it, with the precision of a perfect apex.

## For the F1 Nerds

This server provides **the complete F1 data ecosystem** that actual teams use internally. While everyone else is watching the race on TV, you'll have:

**Real-Time Race Intelligence:**
- Live telemetry showing exactly when drivers lift and coast
- GPS coordinates to see racing lines and track position battles  
- Team radio to hear the strategy calls before the broadcast picks them up
- Race control messages to know about flags and investigations instantly

**Strategic Analysis:**
- Tire degradation patterns to predict pit windows
- Sector analysis to identify where each driver's pace advantage comes from
- Championship mathematics for every possible scenario
- Weather data that actually affects strategy (not just dramatic commentary)

**Historical Context:**
- Complete F1 database from 1950 to track long-term patterns
- Constructor development trends across decades
- Driver performance comparisons across different eras

Because being an F1 fan isn't just about cheering for your driver. It's about understanding the sport at a level that makes you insufferable at parties, but absolutely essential during race weekend discussions.

**"It's lights out and away we go... but you already knew the optimal pit strategy 10 laps ago thanks to 180R."**
